## Rules of ten:
1. One branch one study - or 1 feature ```remotes/origin/YourFeature```
2. You should always branch out from the develop branch ```remotes/origin/develop```
3. During the weekly meeting, we will decide if the ```develop``` branch can be merged to the ```master``` branch
4. You need at least one __approved__ review before a merge
5. When merging, you should always choose __squash and merge__
6. You commit message should be __less than 80 chars__
7. Your detailed description should be included in the PR
8. Everything in ```master``` should be considered as __final__
9. Useful features that you consider utilities should be included in ```./utils```
10. Put the dataset sheet you are working on in the ```./Data```, but remember the __sheet__ is confidential, and should not be put on GitHub
